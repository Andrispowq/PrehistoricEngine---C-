# Using the engine

If you wish to use the engine and the example project, without compiling the source code, follow these steps:
- Click on the Releases tab in the repository
- Under Assets, download `PrehistoricEngineSetup.exe`
- Once it is downloaded, run the installer, and when it is finished installing, uncheck `Run oalinst.exe`, and click Finish
- The installer will now install the MSVC 2015-2019 Redistributable
- Once everything is finished, go to the directory where you have installed the engine, go under `Prehistoric Engine/redist`, and run `oalinst.exe` in Administrator mode to install the OpenAL 1.1 SDK
- Now, you can run the engine with either `Prehistoric.exe` or by using the icon created on the Desktop
